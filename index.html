                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>COVID-19, also known as the coronavirus, is a virus that originated in China and rapidly spread around the world. Beginning in early 2020, nations all across the globe, including the United States, issued many new regulations to hopefully slow the spread of the virus.</p>
                <p>In the United States, however, there have been more than five million confirmed COVID-19 cases, and it continues to increase every day. More locally in California, coronavirus cases have exceeded 500,000, making it the state with the highest number of infections.</p>

                <p>Since the introduction of COVID-19 into the daily lives of Americans, the “new normal” involves many choosing to self-isolate and quarantine within their homes, parents working remotely, children and young adults attending school online, wearing protective masks when going out in public, and practicing social distancing at all times.</p>
                <p>The transition from what we previously perceived as normal to this time of the coronavirus has been difficult for many, but there is a wide variety of resources available online and in-person to aid people in learning more about the virus and how to be as safe as possible.</p>

                <h2>The Tang Center at UC Berkeley</h2>
                <p>At the University of California, Berkeley, the University Health Services at the Tang Center have many resources related to COVID-19 to help students receive the testing or information that they need.</p>
                <p>Sheng Hsu, a nurse practitioner who works in primary care at the Tang Center, clarified testing procedures and Tang Center availability in an interview.</p>
                <p>Hsu explained that SHIP insurance is not necessary for UC Berkeley students to receive COVID-19 testing or other services provided by the Tang Center. Approximately 7,000 students have been tested for the virus at the Tang Center so far, and their adjusted hours of in-person operation due to the pandemic are 10 am to 4 pm.</p>
                <p>“COVID-19 testing has changed since it began in March but the testing procedures include calling the Tang Center to schedule a phone appointment. They will talk to you to make sure you don’t need any further evaluation and then you can drive up or walk up and get tested outside on Durant Avenue,” Hsu said.</p>
                <p>Because there are fewer students on campus and will be for the Fall 2020 semester as well, Hsu stated that the Tang Center and University Health Services are working toward increasing their availability with virtual services and telehealthcare.</p>

                <h4>Preventative Measures</h4>
                <p>When asked to speak on ways to prevent the spread of COVID-19, Hsu said, “Some preventative measures that people can take to help during the pandemic include hand hygiene like washing hands, not shaking hands, and not hugging. People should also be social distancing and wearing masks whenever in public.”</p>

                <p>“Wearing masks is extremely important. It helps prevent someone that could be asymptomatic or actually have symptoms of COVID-19 from spreading it to someone else. Masks help contain the droplets or aerosols inside, and studies have also shown that masks help prevent people from getting COVID-19 as well,” Hsu said.</p>

                <h2>COVID-19 Testing</h2>
                <p>In the state of California, there are multiple resources online to learn about common COVID-19 symptoms and the qualifications to get free testing. The state determines testing availability based on a tier system, with those at more risk having more accessibility to testing.
